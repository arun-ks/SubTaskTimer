# SubTaskTimer

Simple tool to track the time taken for sub-steps/laps.

The default configuration helps log time at individual checkpoints during a regular morning routine.

## Demo
Online version can be [seen here](https://arun-ks.github.io/SubTaskTimer/)

## How it works

The easy to configure list of checkpoints are identified with buttons, pressing them will log the current time.

This timestamp can be updated manually if required.

## But here's more
The portal stores the timestamp in **local storage**, this means that even if browser crashes or the page is closed, the system will recall/recover the old timestamps.

There are buttons to reset the values & to store values in local storage. If timestamps are updated using the input-time textbox, then this store button will need to be used.
